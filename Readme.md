## ANTD THEME COMPILER

> Nothing fancy, uses [LaravelMix](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mix) to compile ant design less theme.

## Using it.

- Clone repo (or not).
- Modify [file]('./myTheme.less') with your desired changes. You should mimic the default antd [theme](./node_modules/antd/dist/antd.less) as much as possible.
- Run `$ yarn dev`
- There you go!
